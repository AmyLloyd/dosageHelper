They'll Never forget a single dose again! With the client checklist, all medications prescribed will appear as a tickable checklist that's easily printed for the client. This way their beloved animals get all the right doses at all the right times.

With further development, this chart will be printable as a PDF. 

In later development stages, we look forward to creating a Client user UI where clients are able to login to the platform and dosageHelper will be an interactive tick list that stores the time the medication was given. This will allow for good communication among multiple owners of the one dog. 

After completing a dose, be sure to tick it off in the chart.
